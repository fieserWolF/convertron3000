# Convertron3000

Convertron3000 is a graphics converter for Commodore 64 computers.
It runs on 64 bit versions of Linux, MacOS, Windows and other systems supported by Python.

# Why Convertron3000?

reason | description
---|---
open source | easy to modify and to improve, any useful contribution is highly welcome
portable | available on Linux, MacOS, Windows and any other system supported by Python3
instant preview | just fiddle around with the sliders and see the result before converting
deal with color clashes | visualize color clashes instantly or read out their position from an optional json-file


# Usage

Using Convertron3000 is pretty straight-forward:

* Open some image.
* Adjust the sliders or apply an effect.
* Convert to koala or hires format.
* optional: Check position of color-clashes.
* Save the resulting image.


# Commandline options

	CONVERTRON3000 v1.33 [build 250322-030736] *** by fieserWolF
	usage: convertron.py [-h] [-i INPUT_IMAGE] [-c CLASHES_JSON] [-o CLASHES_IMAGE] [-d]

	This program reads an image-file, lets the user adjust settings and converts it to a C64 koala or hires image.

	options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -i, --image INPUT_IMAGE
							image file)
	  -c, --clashes CLASHES_JSON
							filename of report containing all color-clashes (in json-format (default="/tmp/color_clashes.json")
	  -o, --output CLASHES_IMAGE
							filename of color-clash image (default="/tmp/color_clashes.png")
	  -d, --debug           show color-clashes on consule

	Example: ./convertron.py -i image.png -c /tmp/clashes.json -d



# Dithering

As of now, Convertron3000 offers various dithering methods.
As the PIL-library only implements "floyd-steinberg"-dithering, all other dithering methods were taken from the hitherdither library.

reason | description
---|---
floyd-steinberg dithering | speedy performance from the PIL-library
bayer-ordered dithering | the speedy standard, my favourite for C64 pictures
line dithering | a modified bayer-ordered dithering method, sometimes looks better than normal ordered dithering
dot dithering | not my favourite, but might give nice results on some pictures
yliluomas1 dithering | Warning: Painfully slow - use with care! The results are stunningly good sometimes, though.


Please, take note that all dithering implementations except "floyd-steinberg"-dithering are quite slow when using the "Brightness palette"-mode, which is described below.




# Brightness palette

Sometimes converted images look better when applying a palette based on brightness values.

* Select "brightness palette" mode.
* Choose one of the presets ("purple", "brown" etc.).

You can also create your own palette like this:

* Edit the .json file: In the .json file you specify the size of your palette and the C64-colors like in one of the examples provided.
* Open your .json file. You find this option in the drop-down menu under "open custom gradient".
* Choose "custom" as your brightness palette.




# File Formats

The multicolor bitmap is stored in the widely-spread KoalaPainter (.koa) format:

* 2 bytes load address
* 8000 bytes raw bitmap data
* 1000 bytes raw "Video Matrix" (screen) data
* 1000 bytes raw "Color RAM" data
* 1 byte background data

The hires bitmap is stored in the widely-spread Advanced Art Studio (.art) format:

* 2 bytes load address
* 8000 bytes raw bitmap data
* 1000 bytes raw "Video Matrix" (screen) data

# Getting Started

Convertron3000 comes in two flavors:

- standalone executable for 64-bit systems Linux, MacOS/Darwin and Windows (see [releases](https://github.com/fieserWolF/convertron3000/releases))
- Python3 script

## Run the standalone executable

Just download your bundle at [releases](https://github.com/fieserWolF/convertron3000/releases) and enjoy.
Keep in mind that only 64bit systems are supported as I could not find a 32bit system to generate the bundle.

### Note for Windows users

If some antivirus scanner puts Convertron3000 into quarantine because it suspects a trojan or virus, simply put it out there again.
It isn`t harmful, I used PyInstaller to bundle the standalone executable for you.
Unfortunately, the PyInstaller bootloader triggers a false alarm on some systems.
I even tried my best and re-compiled the PyInstaller bootloader so that this should not happen anymore. Keep your fingers crossed ;)

### Note for MacOS users

Your system might complain that the code is not signed by a certificated developer. Well, I am not, so I signed the program on my own. 
```
"Convertron3000" can`t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.
```
You need to right-click or Control-click the app and select “Open”.



## Run the Python3 script directly

Download _convertron.py_ and the whole _resource_ - directory into the same folder on your computer.

### Prerequisites

At least this is needed to run the script directly:

- python 3
- python tkinter module
- python "The Python Imaging Library" (PIL)
- python "argparse" library
- python "hitherdither" library


Normally, you would use pip like this:
```
pip3 install tk pillow argparse git+https://www.github.com/hbldh/hitherdither
```

On my Debian GNU/Linux machine I use apt-get to install everything needed:
```
apt update
apt install python3 python3-tk python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk
pip3 install git+https://www.github.com/hbldh/hitherdither
```
