# Convertron3000

Convertron3000 is a graphics converter for Commodore 64 computers.

## Getting Started

As it is written in Python2.7 it depends a little on which OS you are starting Convertron3000.
On Linux and Mac OS you might want to install needed modules first (see Prerequisites). On Windows you may want to use the contents of the ZIP file and start the .exe.

### Prerequisites

- python 2.7
- python Numpy module
- python tkinter module
- python "The Python Imaging Library" (PIL)

On my Debian machine I use apt-get to install everything needed:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install python2.7 python-tk python-numpy python-pil
```

### Installing

There is nothing to install apart from the prerequisites.
